\title{scorematchingad: Score Matching Estimation by Automatic Differentiation}
\description{
Hyv√§rinen's score matching \url{https://jmlr.org/papers/v6/hyvarinen05a.html} is a useful estimation technique when the normalising constant for a probability distribution is difficult to compute. This package implements score matching estimators using automatic differentiation in the CppAD library \url{https://github.com/coin-or/CppAD} and is designed for quickly implementing score matching estimators for new models. General Windham robustification \url{https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346159} is also available. Already in the package are estimators for directional distributions (Mardia, Kent and Laha (2016) \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08470}{arXiv:1604.08470}) and the flexible Polynomially-Tilted Pairwise Interaction (PPI) model for compositional data. The latter estimators perform well when there are zeros in the compositions (Scealy and Wood, 2023 \doi{10.1080/01621459.2021.2016422}), even many zeros (Scealy, Hingee, Kent, and Wood, 2024, 2024 \doi{10.1007/s11222-024-10412-w}).

\details{
This package's main features are
\itemize{
\item A general capacity to implement score matching estimators that use algorithmic differentiation to avoid tedious manual algebra.
The package uses \code{CppAD} and \code{Eigen} to differentiate model densities and compute the score matching discrepancy function (see \code{\link{scorematchingtheory}}).
The score matching discrepancy is usually minimised by solving a quadratic equation, but a method for solving numerically (through \code{\link[optimx:Rcgmin]{optimx::Rcgmin()}}) is also included.
On Linux platforms using the \code{gcc} compiler new models can be fitted with the help of \code{\link[=customll]{customll()}}, in a similar fashion to models in the \code{TMB} package.
New manifolds or new transforms require small alterations to the source code of this package.
\item Score matching estimators for the Polynomially-Tilted Pairwise Interaction (PPI) model \insertCite{scealy2023sc,scealy2024ro}{scorematchingad}. See function \code{\link[=ppi]{ppi()}}.
\item Score matching and hybrid score matching estimators for von Mises Fisher, Bingham and Fisher-Bingham directional distributions \insertCite{mardia2016sc}{scorematchingad}. See \code{\link[=vMF]{vMF()}}, \code{\link[=Bingham]{Bingham()}} and \code{\link[=FB]{FB()}}.
\item Implementation of a modification of Windham's robustifying method \insertCite{windham1995ro}{scorematchingad} for many exponential family distributions. See \code{\link[=Windham]{Windham()}}.
For some models the density approaches infinity at some locations, creating difficulties for the weights in Windham's original method \insertCite{scealy2024ro}{scorematchingad}.
